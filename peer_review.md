# Peer Review for Huzaifa’s Titanic Survival Classification Project

**Notebook**: [Titanic Survival Classification Notebook](https://github.com/HuzaifaUCMO/ml_classification_huzaifanadeem/blob/main/classification_huzaifanadeem.ipynb)  
**Reviewer**: Mhamed Maatou  
**Date**: April 06, 2025

## 1. Clarity & Organization
- The notebook is well-organized, and it is easy to follow the steps from data loading to model evaluation.
- However, it could benefit from more detailed explanations of key decisions to improve clarity.
  
### Recommendations:
- Including more high-level explanations at the start of each section would improve readability and flow, especially for those unfamiliar with the dataset or the problem.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
- The chosen features are well-justified for predicting survival on the Titanic.
  - **Age** and **Fare** are logical demographic features.
  - **Pclass** and **Sex** provide key indicators of survival priority.
  - **FamilySize** and **IsAlone** introduce an interesting social dimension that could impact survival likelihood.
- The decision to drop sparse columns like **Cabin** and **Ticket** is justified due to the high proportion of missing values.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
- The notebook evaluates three models: **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression**, using comprehensive metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The **Decision Tree**'s confusion matrix and classification report highlight performance issues, such as lower recall for survivors.
- The explanation of **Random Forest**'s superior performance is clearly provided.

### Recommendations:
- It would be useful to add more discussion on why the **Decision Tree** model underperformed and how model tuning (e.g., hyperparameter optimization) might improve its performance.

## 4. Reflection Quality
- The reflections in the notebook are brief and could benefit from more in-depth analysis.
  - For example, the impact of **class imbalance** and **outliers** on model results could be explored, along with potential solutions like resampling or using different metrics.
  - The discussion on **Decision Tree** overfitting and **Random Forest’s** performance could be expanded to include strategies for mitigating overfitting and handling outliers.
